## About the project

This project uses Generative AI to help with two main challenges: understanding complex language ideas and setting up an effective study plan. By adding AI into the learning process, we want to make studying more efficient and easier to understand.
## **How to get started**

To kick off, explore the insights provided by Generative AI on language nuances and study routine optimization. These examples serve as a foundation for applying AI in my learning strategy.

### **Language Learning Insight**

#### Question:
Can you tell me what the difference is between ～ようになる and ～ようにする?

#### Answer:
Sure! I'll explain the difference between **～ようになる** and **～ようにする**:

- **～ようになる**:
  - Refers to a gradual change that occurs over time, indicating the acquisition of a new state or ability.
  - Example: Coming to understand Japanese after studying regularly.

- **～ようにする**:
  - Used when there is a conscious effort to make something happen, representing intentional action to achieve a goal.
  - Example: Making an effort to study Japanese every day.

### **Study Routine Optimization**

#### Question:
Create a study routine for me to do every week to study for the Green Belt course, knowing that I have an internship from 6:30 am to 4:30 pm and college from 7:20 pm to 10:30 pm from Monday to Friday.

#### Answer:
Here's an optimized routine to balance your internship, college, and the **Green Belt** course:

1. **Internship (6:30 am to 4:30 pm)**: Focus on work, applying Lean Six Sigma concepts when possible.
2. **Pre-College Study (4:30 pm to 7:20 pm)**: Dedicate this time to review Green Belt material.
3. **College (7:20 pm to 10:30 pm)**: Pay attention to classes, trying to relate concepts with the Green Belt.
4. **Weekend**: Intensive study of the Green Belt, reading additional materials, and working on practical projects.
